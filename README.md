# Long Short-term Cognitive Networks

Long Short-term Cognitive Networks (LSTCNs) [1] are a computationally efficient recurrent neural network devoted to time series forecasting. This model supports one-step ahead and multiple-step ahead forecasting for univariate and multivariate time series. However, this model is highly recommended for multivariate settings and multiple-step ahead forecasting. LSTCNs are competitive compared to state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks in terms of forecasting error while being much faster.

## Install

LSTCN can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lstcn):

<pre>
pip install lstcn
